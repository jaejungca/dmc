# Data Preparation {.smaller}

First, we need to:\
1. load **packages**\
2. read in **data**\
3. check if that data is *in the right format*

[By "right format", we mean that the data is tidy, and ready to be summarized and graphed.]{.aside}

## Choosing Data

> Penguins are very cute!

... so let's work with penguin data today.

::: callout-note
For this analysis we will use the `penguins` dataset from the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package [@horst2020].
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Expand to learn more about where the data was collected

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.
:::

## Loading packages

::: {.callout-important .smaller}
### Using the data without downloading it

This same dataset is also available in the almerpenguins package.
:::

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(gt)
```

## Reading Data

```{r}
#| label: head-data
#| output-location: fragment

head(penguins)
glimpse(penguins)

```

## Cleaning the data {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-data
#| output-location: default


penguins |> 
  drop_na() -> penguins_no_na
penguins_no_na
```

We have removed missing values here, which means that the data has now `r nrow(penguins_no_na)` rows. Note that previously there were `r nrow(penguins)` rows in the original data.[^1]

[^1]: Note that this removes any rows with missing values!

## Code Annotation

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <2>
  )                                              # <2>
```

1.  Take `penguins`, and then,
2.  add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.

# Charts by Species {.smaller}

@fig-bill-dims-species is a bar plot of species of penguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bill-dims-species
#| fig-cap: Penguin bill dimensions
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618
#| fig-alt: |
#|    A scatterplot of penguins' bill depth and length, 
#|    colored by species of penguins. There is a strong, linear 
#|    association.   
#| warning: false
#| output-location: slide


 penguins |> 
   ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species,
              shape = species))+
   geom_point() +
   theme_minimal() +
   scale_color_colorblind() +
   labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
        y = "Bill depth (mm)")

```

# Tables {.smaller}

@tbl-penguins-top10 shows the first 10 penguins from the dataset.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-penguins-top10
#| tbl-cap: Top 10 penguins sorted by bill lengths
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|4-5"
#| output-location: column-fragment

penguins |> 
  slice_head(n = 10) |> 
  select(species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) |> 
  arrange(-bill_length_mm) |> 
  gt()

```

# How to post online {.smaller}

1.  Create your content in Quarto. You need at least three documents.

    1.  index.qmd

    2.  another qmd file

    3.  "\_quarto.yml" created in Text File.

2.  Reload the project from the upper-right-hand corner. After this, you should see the "Build" tab appear.

3.  Click "Render Website" and confirm that you have a website with the two files combined.

4.  Now it is time to publish.

    1.  Move to the terminal

    2.  Type "quarto publish quarto-pub" and follow the instructions there.

    3.  Go to your quarto pub and find the website.
