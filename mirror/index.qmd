# Data

For this analysis we will use the `penguins` dataset from the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(gt)

```

# Species

The figure below is a bar plot of species of penguins.

```{r}
#| label: bill-dims-species
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618

 penguins |> 
   ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species,
              shape = species))+
   geom_point() +
   theme_minimal() +
   scale_color_colorblind() +
   labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
        y = "Bill depth (mm)")

```

# Penguins

The table below shows the first 10 penguins from the dataset.

```{r}
#| label: penguins-top10

penguins |> 
  slice_head(n = 10) |> 
  select(species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) |> 
  gt()

```
